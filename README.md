# Projects-w--Node--Express--React--MongoDB
I built a fruit application using Node, Express, React and MongoDB, CRUD Functionality. <br><br>
This project allows you to see different object information about fruits using routes on localhost:3000/fruits. <br><br>
You are able to search the different routes by using the index number of the object. <br><br>
On the Index page you can create a new post to update the in-formation. <br><br>
I made this fruits application in my coding bootcamp 05-15-22. <br><br>
